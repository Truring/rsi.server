# RSI server module

This project implements the Volkswagen Infotainment Web Interface (viwi/RSI) as published under [https://www.w3.org/Submission/2016/01/](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2016/01/). The module provides a server which works with plugins like:

* [@RSI-plugins/medialibrary](https://github.com/wzr1337/rsi-plugins.medialibrary)


## Development
Anyone is invited to join our forces and help implement, test or document the software provided inhere.

### Install local dependencies
To install the server's dependencies, run the following command

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Build it
To build the server, use

```sh
$ npm run build
```

## Examples

### Using the module
While there is a [RSI Demo](https://github.com/wzr1337/rsi.demo) available, a minimal working example would be:

```typescript
import { RsiServer } from '@rsi/server';
import * as m from '@rsi-plugins/media';

const server: RsiServer = new RsiServer();
server.run(); // run the server
server.addService(m.Medialibrary.getInstance()); // add a single service
```

accessing `http://127.0.0.1:3000` will give you the following response:

```JSON
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "ea65d5eb-d5fb-4ceb-a568-ed24fcf37e20",
      "name": "Medialibrary",
      "uri": "/medialibrary/"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Client side subscription

To subscribe to the netfux media renderer from within a JavaScript application or the JavaScript console, use the following code snippet

```js
ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000");
ws.onopen = () => {
  ws.onmessage = (data) => {console.log(JSON.parse(data.data))}
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({type:"subscribe", event:"/media/renderers/d6ebfd90-d2c1-11e6-9376-df943f51f0d8"}))
}
```
